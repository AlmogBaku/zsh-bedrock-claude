## How It Works
To be fair, this is super naive and simple - a quick helper utility.


The plugin manages environment variables to control Claude Code's behavior:
- **Enable**: Sets `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1` and restores saved model configurations
- **Disable**: Removes the Bedrock flag and saves current model settings for later restoration


## Why Use This Plugin?

- **Easy Toggle**: Switch between Anthropic API and AWS Bedrock with a simple command
- **State Preservation**: Remembers your model configurations when switching
- **Interactive Menu**: User-friendly interface with arrow key navigation
- **Session-Based**: Quick switching without permanent configuration changes
